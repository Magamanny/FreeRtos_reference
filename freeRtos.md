# FreeRTOS

## PortMacro

This is the function defined in portmacro.h.

```c
// The braces and semicolon are just of formating
{
    // number of tick in a ms
    portTICK_PERIOD_MS
	// A macro used to define prototype of a task function
	portTASK_FUNCTION_PROTO( vFunction, pvParameters );
	// A macro used to define the body of a task function
	portTASK_FUNCTION( vFunction, pvParameters );
    // This are port specific and call vPortEnterCritical, and vPortExitCritical/
    /* Use taskENTER_CRITICAL(), and taskEXIT_CRITICAL() instead form API for app writing. */
    portENTER_CRITICAL();
    portEXIT_CRITICAL();
    // Request context switch from ISR, the taskYIELD() dont have the ISR safe funtionc
    // so use this is ISR, will do the same thing
    portYIELD_FROM_ISR (pdTRUE);
    // like task yield, taskYIELD() is maped on this, used taskYIELD() in app
    portYIELD();
}
```

portTASK_FUNCTION and portTASK_FUNCTION_PROTO macros. These macro are provided to allow compiler specific syntax to be added to the function definition and prototype respectively. Their use is not required unless specifically stated in documentation for the port being used (currently only the PIC18 fedC port).

## Task Creation

> Note: Call vTaskStartScheduler() otherwise the task will not run.

### xTaskCreate

Create a new task and add it to the list of tasks that are ready to run. 

> **Note**: configSUPPORT_DYNAMIC_ALLOCATION must be set to 1 in FreeRTOSConfig.h(or not be defined at all), or left undefined (in which case it will default to 1), for this RTOS API function to be available.

**Example usage:**

```c
/* configMINIMAL_STACK_SIZE is configured in FreeRTOSConfig.h, this is set to 130 in this example */
#define ledSTACK_SIZE		configMINIMAL_STACK_SIZE'
/* see portmacro.h, this just expends to -> static void vTaskMyLed_1(pvParameters)*/
static portTASK_FUNCTION_PROTO( vTaskMyLed_1, pvParameters );
void main()
{
    /* Some stuff */
    // tskIDLE_PRIORITY = 0 // see task.h and is the lowest priority task
    // "LEDx" is the task name
    xTaskCreate( vTaskMyLed_1,
                 "LEDx",
                 ledSTACK_SIZE,
                 NULL,
                 tskIDLE_PRIORITY,
                 ( TaskHandle_t * ) NULL );
   /* som other stuff */
}
/* This just expends to -> static void vTaskMyLed_1(pvParameters) */
static portTASK_FUNCTION( vTaskMyLed_1, pvParameters ) // this will expend to vTaskCode()
{
    /* Task Initilization */
    for( ;; )
    {
        /* Task Code */
        vParTestToggleLED( 3 ); // toggle an led
        vTaskDelay(60); // wait 60 ms, blocked state
        // Task code goes here.
    }
    /* No work should be done here */
}
```

### Configuration parameter

```c
/* The maximum task priority ideal taks is '0' and max task priority is (configMAX_PRIORITIES-1), thus task priority are 0,1,2 and 3. This can be changed */
#define configMAX_PRIORITIES			( 5 )
```

### Static Task Create

Only avaliable when configSUPPORT_STATIC_ALLOCATION=1.

When using static allocation we need to provide defination of two functions called.

*vApplicationGetIdleTaskMemory* 

*vApplicationGetTimerTaskMemory*

```c
#define STACK_SIZE 200

StaticTask_t xTaskBuffer;
StackType_t xStack[ STACK_SIZE ];

void vTaskCode( void * pvParameters )
{
    configASSERT( ( uint32_t ) pvParameters == 1UL );

    for( ;; )
    {
    }
}
void vOtherFunction( void )
{
    TaskHandle_t xHandle = NULL;
    xHandle = xTaskCreateStatic(
        vTaskCode,       /* Function that implements the task. */
        "NAME",          /* Text name for the task. */
        STACK_SIZE,      /* Number of indexes in the xStack array. */
        ( void * ) 1,    /* Parameter passed into the task. */
        tskIDLE_PRIORITY,/* Priority at which the task is created. */
        xStack,          /* Array to use as the task's stack. */
        &xTaskBuffer );  /* Variable to hold the task's data structure. */
}
```



## Task Control

### vTaskDelay

Delay a task for a given number of ticks. vTaskDelay() specifies a time at which the task wishes to unblock **relative to** the time at which vTaskDelay() is called.

The constant portTICK_PERIOD_MS can be used to calculate real time from the tick rate - with the resolution of one tick period.

The tick rate is 1ms for freeRTOS for, it can be configured using 'configTICK_RATE_HZ'. 100 Hz is normally a good choice. Higher tick rate provide higher resolution time, in expense of processing more tick interrupts.

> **Note**: INCLUDE_vTaskDelay must be defined as 1 for this function to be available.

See code in "xTaskCreate()" for an example usage.

```c
 void vTaskFunction( void * pvParameters )
 {
 /* Block for 500ms. */
 const TickType_t xDelay = 500 / portTICK_PERIOD_MS;

     for( ;; )
     {
         /* Simply toggle the LED every 500ms, blocking between each toggle. */
         vToggleLED();
         vTaskDelay( xDelay );
     }
}
```

### vTaskDelayUntil

Delay a task until a specified time. This function can be used by periodic tasks to ensure a constant execution frequency.

This function differs from vTaskDelay() in one important aspect: vTaskDelay() specifies a time at which the task wishes to unblock *relative* to the time at which vTaskDelay() is called, whereas vTaskDelayUntil() specifies an *absolute* time at which the task wishes to unblock.

> **Note**: INCLUDE_vTaskDelayUntil must be defined as 1 for this function to be available

**Example usage:**

```c
 // Perform an action every 10 ticks.
 void vTaskFunction( void * pvParameters )
 {
 	TickType_t xLastWakeTime; // this is used by the function
     // we can use portTICK_PERIOD_MS for calculing ms
 	const TickType_t xFrequency = 10; // every 10 tick

     // Initialise the xLastWakeTime variable with the current time.
     xLastWakeTime = xTaskGetTickCount();

     for( ;; )
     {
         // Wait for the next cycle.
         vTaskDelayUntil( &xLastWakeTime, xFrequency );
         // Perform action here.
     }
 }
```

### Task Control Configuration

These need to be define in rtos configuration file to use taskDelay functions.

```c
// set to 1 to use vTaskDelayUntil()
#define INCLUDE_vTaskDelayUntil			1
// set to 1 to use vTaskDelay()
#define INCLUDE_vTaskDelay				1
```

## Customization

### Configuration

FreeRTOS is customized using a configuration file called FreeRTOSConfig.h. Blow is the content of the file with a short description each parameter, this is not the complete list. For a complete list refer to FreeRTOS website.

```c
#ifndef FREERTOS_CONFIG_H
#define FREERTOS_CONFIG_H

/* Here is a good place to include header files that are required across
your application. */
#include "something.h"
/* This should be kept as provided in demo app, this is in words not bytes(1 word is 4 bytes), thus it is 130*4 = 520 bytes */
#define configMINIMAL_STACK_SIZE		( ( unsigned short ) 130 )
/* Memory allocation related definitions. */
/* These are set to their default values(we will not define them), see FreeRtos.h */

/* Optional functions */
/* Define features that are to be used, like taskDelay */
/* A header file that defines trace macro can be included here. */

#endif /* FREERTOS_CONFIG_H */
```

### Memory Management

The FreeRtos version 10 provide five heap management schemes. Only one scheme file should be used at a time(personal preference). Following below:

- heap_1 - the very simplest, does not permit memory to be freed.
- heap_2 - permits memory to be freed, but does not coalescence adjacent free blocks.
- heap_3 - simply wraps the standard malloc() and free() for thread safety.
- heap_4 - coalescences adjacent free blocks to avoid fragmentation. Includes absolute address placement option.
- heap_5 - as per heap_4, with the ability to span the heap across multiple non-adjacent memory areas.

Notes:

- heap_1 is less useful since FreeRTOS added support for static allocation.
- heap_2 is now considered legacy as the newer heap_4 implementation is preferred.

### uxTaskGetStackHighWaterMark

```C
// To get other task watermark pass the task handler to it
void vTask1( void * pvParameters )
{
    UBaseType_t uxHighWaterMark;

    /* Inspect our own high water mark on entering the task. */
    uxHighWaterMark = uxTaskGetStackHighWaterMark( NULL );

    for( ;; )
    {
        /* Call any function. */
        vTaskDelay( 1000 );

        /* Calling the function will have used some stack space, we would 
        therefore now expect uxTaskGetStackHighWaterMark() to return a 
        value lower than when it was called on entering the task. */
        uxHighWaterMark = uxTaskGetStackHighWaterMark( NULL );
    }
}
```



### Stream Buffers vs Message Buffers vs Queues

Here is a reply from 'Richard Barry' creator of FreeRtos.

## RTOS Kernel Control

### taskYIELD

taskYIELD() is used to request a context switch to another task. However, if there are no other tasks at a higher or equal priority to the task that calls taskYIELD() then the RTOS scheduler will simply select the task that called taskYIELD() to run again. Used in cooperative scheduling.

To run the scheduler in cooperative mode set configUSE_PREEMPTION to 0, and for running it in preemptive mode set it to 1.

Function classified as kernel control:

```c
// Macro for forcing a context switch, maps to portYIELD()
taskYIELD();
```

### Critical Region

Critical regions are those area of the code where Preemptive context switch cannot occur. FreeRtos provide function to specify where such section begin and end. The function are as follow:

```c
// Macro to mark the start of a critical code region.  Preemptive context
// switches cannot occur when in a critical region.
taskENTER_CRITICAL();
taskENTER_CRITICAL_FROM_ISR();
// Macro to mark the end of a critical code region
taskEXIT_CRITICAL(x);
taskEXIT_CRITICAL_FROM_ISR(x);
```

The these function can be nested and should be called in pair, the kernel keeps count of the nesting level and will end the critical region when the level reaches zero. No other function should be used as it may change the nesting count.

Critical section are vary fast to execute and are deterministic.

Example:

```c
/* A function called from an ISR. */
void vDemoFunction( void )
{
UBaseType_t uxSavedInterruptStatus;

    /* Enter the critical section.  In this example, this function is itself called from
    within a critical section, so entering this critical section will result in a nesting
    depth of 2. Save the value returned by taskENTER_CRITICAL_FROM_ISR() into a local
    stack variable so it can be passed into taskEXIT_CRITICAL_FROM_ISR(). */
    uxSavedInterruptStatus = taskENTER_CRITICAL_FROM_ISR();

    /* Perform the action that is being protected by the critical section here. */

    /* Exit the critical section.  In this example, this function is itself called from a
    critical section, so interrupts will have already been disabled before a value was
    stored in uxSavedInterruptStatus, and therefore passing uxSavedInterruptStatus into
    taskEXIT_CRITICAL_FROM_ISR() will not result in interrupts being re-enabled. */
    taskEXIT_CRITICAL_FROM_ISR( uxSavedInterruptStatus );
}

/* A task that calls vDemoFunction() from within an interrupt service routine. */
void vDemoISR( void )
{
	UBaseType_t uxSavedInterruptStatus;
    
    /* Call taskENTER_CRITICAL_FROM_ISR() to create a critical section, saving the
    returned value into a local stack variable. */
    uxSavedInterruptStatus = taskENTER_CRITICAL_FROM_ISR();


    /* Execute the code that requires the critical section here. */


    /* Calls to taskENTER_CRITICAL_FROM_ISR() can be nested so it is safe to call a
    function that includes its own calls to taskENTER_CRITICAL_FROM_ISR() and
    taskEXIT_CRITICAL_FROM_ISR(). */
    vDemoFunction();

    /* The operation that required the critical section is complete so exit the
    critical section.  Assuming interrupts were enabled on entry to this ISR, the value
    saved in uxSavedInterruptStatus will result in interrupts being re-enabled.*/
    taskEXIT_CRITICAL_FROM_ISR( uxSavedInterruptStatus );
}
```

### vTaskStartScheduler

Starts the RTOS scheduler. After calling the RTOS kernel has control over which tasks are executed and when.

```c
void vAFunction( void )
 {
     // Tasks can be created before or after starting the RTOS
     scheduler
     xTaskCreate( vTaskCode,
                  "NAME",
                  STACK_SIZE,
                  NULL,
                  tskIDLE_PRIORITY,
                  NULL );

     // Start the real time scheduler.
     vTaskStartScheduler();

     // Will not get here unless there is insufficient RAM.
 }
```



### Kernel Parameters

These parameters are defined in the application FreeRTOSConfig.h file.

```c
/* This is used to select the sheduler mode, cooperative or preemptive. 1 means preemptive mode and 0 means cooperative mode */
#define configUSE_PREEMPTION                    1
/* seems to work with only preemptive mode, if not defined it is set to 1 */
#define configUSE_TIME_SLICING    1
/* The cpu clock that is driving the tick intrrupt, in case of stm32f405 this is the system clock */
#define configCPU_CLOCK_HZ				( SystemCoreClock )
/* This is the tick frequency 1000Hz means that the kernal is running a 1ms accuracy */
#define configTICK_RATE_HZ				( ( TickType_t ) 1000 )

```

### Stream Buffers

The underline information is given in the stream buffer file.

```c
/*
 * Stream buffers are used to send a continuous stream of data from one task or
 * interrupt to another.  Their implementation is light weight, making them
 * particularly suited for interrupt to task and core to core communication
 * scenarios.
 *
 * ***NOTE***:  Uniquely among FreeRTOS objects, the stream buffer
 * implementation (so also the message buffer implementation, as message buffers
 * are built on top of stream buffers) assumes there is only one task or
 * interrupt that will write to the buffer (the writer), and only one task or
 * interrupt that will read from the buffer (the reader).  It is safe for the
 * writer and reader to be different tasks or interrupts, but, unlike other
 * FreeRTOS objects, it is not safe to have multiple different writers or
 * multiple different readers.  If there are to be multiple different writers
 * then the application writer must place each call to a writing API function
 * (such as xStreamBufferSend()) inside a critical section and set the send
 * block time to 0.  Likewise, if there are to be multiple different readers
 * then the application writer must place each call to a reading API function
 * (such as xStreamBufferReceive()) inside a critical section section and set the
 * receive block time to 0.
 *
 * Use xStreamBufferSend() to write to a stream buffer from a task.  Use
 * xStreamBufferSendFromISR() to write to a stream buffer from an interrupt
 * service routine (ISR).
 */
```

Stream buffers are an RTOS task to RTOS task, and interrupt to task communication primitives.Unlike most other FreeRTOS communications primitives, they are optimised for single reader single writer scenarios, such as passing data from an interrupt service routine to a task, or from one microcontroller core to another on dual core CPUs. Data is passed by copy - the data is copied into the buffer by the sender and out of the buffer by the read.

Functions:

```c
// handle to that is used to access the buffer
static StreamBufferHandle_t xStreamBuffer = NULL;
// creating functions
xStreamBufferCreate();
// reciving funciotns
xStreamBufferReceive();
xStreamBufferReceiveFromISR();
// sending function
xStreamBufferSend();
xStreamBufferSendFromISR();
```

}
recivingTask()
{
    static char cRxBuffer[ 20 ];
    static BaseType_t xNextByte = 0;
    size_t xReceivedBytes;
    // set block time to portMAX_DELAY, to wait till trigger level is reached
    // pdMS_TO_TICKS convert the ms to ticks(taht can be used in vtaskDelay and others functions.)
    const TickType_t xBlockTime = pdMS_TO_TICKS( 20 );
    for(;;)
    {

    {
      // Actual macro used here is port specific.
      portYIELD_FROM_ISR (pdTRUE);
    }
}
```

## Queue

### xQueueCreate

xQueueCreate will create Queue. It will take two argument i.e. Queue length and size of object to be placed inside the queue. This function should be called in main function. Queue handle should be made, that will have the status of the xQueueCreate function.

The example code uses a queue to send data from a 'task' to a 2nd 'task'. The 2nd task will send a message when a button is pressed.

```c
#include "queue.h"
//Define queue length
static uint8_t msg_queue_len = 5;

//Queue handle
static QueueHandle_t msg_queue;

//Queue create
// call this is a function, or main setup function, this is just an example
void setupFunction()
{
	msg_queue = xQueueCreate(msg_queue_len, sizeof(int));
}
//create task function
static portTASK_FUNCTION_PROTO( Queue_sendTask_button, pvParameters );
static portTASK_FUNCTION_PROTO( Queue_receiveTask, pvParameters );

//In main
void setupFunction2()
{
    xTaskCreate( Queue_sendTask,
    			"send",
    			configMINIMAL_STACK_SIZE,
    			NULL,
    			tskIDLE_PRIORITY,
    			( TaskHandle_t * ) NULL );
    xTaskCreate( Queue_receiveTask,
    			 "receive",
    			 configMINIMAL_STACK_SIZE,
    			 NULL,
    			 tskIDLE_PRIORITY,
    			 ( TaskHandle_t * ) NULL );
}
// this will expend to vTaskCode()
static Queue_receiveTask( Queue_receiveTask, pvParameters )
{
  uint8_t item;
  uint8_t index=0;
  for( ;; )
  {
    
    if(xQueueReceive(msg_queue,(void *) &item,0)==pdTRUE){
      asm("NOP");
      item_array[index++] = item;
    }
    vTaskDelay(100);
    // Task code goes here.
  }
}

static portTASK_FUNCTION( Queue_sendTask_button, pvParameters ) 
{
  uint8_t btn_state_now;
  uint8_t btn_state_prev;
  static uint8_t num=0;
  for( ;; )
  {
    if(GPIO_ReadInputDataBit(GPIOB,GPIO_Pin_12)==Bit_RESET)
    {
      btn_state_now=0;
    }
    else
    {
      btn_state_now=1;
    }
    if(btn_state_now != btn_state_prev)
    {
      btn_state_prev=btn_state_now;
      if(btn_state_now==0)
      {
       
        if(xQueueSend(msg_queue,(void *)&num,10) != pdTRUE){
        //queue full
        }
        num++;
      }
    }
    vTaskDelay(100);
    // Task code goes here.
  }
}
```

### xQueueReset

```c
BaseType_t xQueueReset( QueueHandle_t xQueue );
//usage
xQueueReset(dispenser_queue); // will return pdPASS
```

Resets a queue to its original empty state.

### xQueueIsQueueFullFromISR

queue.h

```
BaseType_t xQueueIsQueueFullFromISR( const QueueHandle_t xQueue );
```

Queries a queue to determine if the queue is full. This function should only be used in an ISR.

- **Parameters:**

  *xQueue* The handle of the queue being queried

- **Returns:**

  pdFALSE if the queue is not full, or pdTRUE if the queue is full.

```c
if(xQueueIsQueueFullFromISR(queue)==pdTRUE )
{
 // do thing when queue is full
}
```



## UART Transmit and Receive 

We will configure UART same as in SPL(Standard peripheral library). Only one thing will change in the configuration that is the priority of the interrupt. Its priority should be lower configLIBRARY_MAX_SYSCALL_INTERRUPT_PRIORITY.  

 The highest interrupt priority that can be used by any interrupt service
routine that makes calls to interrupt safe FreeRTOS API functions.  DO NOT CALL
INTERRUPT SAFE FREERTOS API FUNCTIONS FROM ANY INTERRUPT THAT HAS A HIGHER
PRIORITY THAN THIS! **(higher priorities are lower numeric values. )**

```c
//This is already defined in FreeRTOSConfig.h file
#define configLIBRARY_MAX_SYSCALL_INTERRUPT_PRIORITY	5 
```

Thus the ISR should be of value higher or equal to 5. This means interrupts of 5,6,7..15 can use the FreeRTOS ISR safe function inside them, and ISR of 0,1,2,3 and 4 cannot use the FreeRTOS ISR safe functions.(ISR safe function are define in FreeRTOS docs)

The below example receives characters from uart5 and echo them back using a task, this demonstrate queues.

### UART Configuration

```c
// configure usart5 as tx and rx
void UART5_Configuration(uint32_t Baud)
{
	GPIO_InitTypeDef  GPIO_InitStructure;
	USART_InitTypeDef USART_InitStructure;
	NVIC_InitTypeDef  NVIC_InitStructure;

	// Enable GPIOC CLOCK
	RCC_AHB1PeriphClockCmd(RCC_AHB1Periph_GPIOC, ENABLE);

	//Enable GPIOD CLOCK
	RCC_AHB1PeriphClockCmd(RCC_AHB1Periph_GPIOD, ENABLE);

	//Enable UART5 CLOCK
	RCC_APB1PeriphClockCmd(RCC_APB1Periph_UART5, ENABLE);

	// Configure the PD12 as a UART5 alternate pin.
	GPIO_PinAFConfig(GPIOC, GPIO_PinSource12, GPIO_AF_UART5);

	GPIO_InitStructure.GPIO_OType					= GPIO_OType_PP;
	GPIO_InitStructure.GPIO_PuPd 					= GPIO_PuPd_UP;

### UART Receive Data

We will use ISR to receive the data and save it in Queue. we will first create the queue and specify its length.

```c
// this should be in scope of both sender and reciver
//Define queue length
static uint8_t msg_queue1_len = 10;

//Queue handle
static QueueHandle_t msg_queue1;
```



```c
//Queue Creation
// in main setup function
msg_queue1 = xQueueCreate(msg_queue1_len, sizeof(char));
```



```c
void UART5_IRQHandler(void)
{
  //definations for QueuefromISR
  char cIn;
  BaseType_t xHigherPriorityTaskWoken;
  // We have not woken a task at the start of the ISR.
  xHigherPriorityTaskWoken = pdFALSE;
  if (USART_GetITStatus(UART5, USART_IT_RXNE) != RESET)
  {
    cIn = USART_ReceiveData(UART5);
    // Post the byte.
    xQueueSendFromISR( msg_queue1, &cIn, &xHigherPriorityTaskWoken );
    // Now the buffer is empty we can switch context if necessary.
    if( xHigherPriorityTaskWoken )
    {
      // Actual macro used here is port specific.
      portYIELD_FROM_ISR (pdTRUE);
    }
    USART_ClearITPendingBit(UART5, USART_IT_RXNE);
  }
}
```

### UART Send Data

 We will make a task to receive the queue that is send from the interrupt. 

```c
//task function
static portTASK_FUNCTION_PROTO( newTask, pvParameters );

//task creation in main function
xTaskCreate( newTask, "rxTask", ledSTACK_SIZE, NULL, tskIDLE_PRIORITY, ( TaskHandle_t * ) NULL );
```

```c
static portTASK_FUNCTION( newTask, pvParameters ) // this will expend to vTaskCode()
{
    char tempChar1=0;
    static uint8_t item_array[20];
    for( ;; )
    {
        // receive queue
        if(xQueueReceive(msg_queue1,(void *) &tempChar1,0)==pdTRUE)
        {
            usart_SendChar(UART5,tempChar1);
        }
        vTaskDelay(100);   //reduce the delay to see the received data quickly.
        // Task code goes here.
    }
}
```

### RTOS Task Notifications

portMAX_DELAY means wait forever. notification used to sync two task, as binary semaphores. 

function used.

xTaskNotifyGiveIndexed( xLed1_Task, 0 );

ulTaskNotifyTakeIndexed( 0,pdTRUE,portMAX_DELAY );

```c
static TaskHandle_t xLed1_Task; // must be global
void main()
{
xTaskCreate( vTaskMyLed_1, "LED_1", ledSTACK_SIZE, NULL, tskIDLE_PRIORITY, &xLed1_Task );
}
static portTASK_FUNCTION( vTaskMyLed_1, pvParameters ) // this will expend to vTaskCode()
{ 
  for( ;; )
  {
    ulTaskNotifyTakeIndexed( 0,               /* Use the 0th notification */
                                 pdTRUE,          /* Clear the notification value 
                                                     before exiting. */
                                 portMAX_DELAY ); /* Block indefinitely. */
    vParTestToggleLED( 3 );
    vTaskDelay(60);
    // Task code goes here.
  }
}
static portTASK_FUNCTION( vTaskMyButton, pvParameters )
{
  for( ;; )
  {
    if(GPIO_ReadInputDataBit(GPIOB,GPIO_Pin_12)==Bit_RESET)
    {
      if(xLed1_Task != NULL)
      {
        xTaskNotifyGiveIndexed( xLed1_Task, 0 );
      }
    }
    vTaskDelay(100);
    // Task code goes here.
  }
}
```

A simple approach will be to use 'xTaskNotify' and 'xTaskNotifyGive' for single notification.

Note: in arduino freertos the xTaskNotifyGiveIndexed where not present(Prior to FreeRTOS V10.4.0)

### Mutexes

Mutexes are RTOS objects that are used for resource management. The word is originate form the word 'MUTual EXclution'.

To use mutexes the the freertosConfig should have:

```c
#define configUSE_MUTEXES				1
// 1 to include recursive mutexes, otherwise set it to zero
#define configUSE_RECURSIVE_MUTEXES		1
```

```c
#include "semphr.h" // has the defination of the function used
static SemaphoreHandle_t xMutex; // mutex global socp
void setup()
{
    xMutex = xSemaphoreCreateMutex();
}
static void func_one( const char *pcString )
{
 xSemaphoreTake( xMutex, portMAX_DELAY ); // take the mutex/token
 // Use the lock resource
 // when done
 xSemaphoreGive( xMutex ); // give it back so other can use it
}
static void func_two( const char *pcString )
{
 xSemaphoreTake( xMutex, portMAX_DELAY ); // take the mutex/token
 // Use the lock resource
 // when done
 xSemaphoreGive( xMutex ); // give it back so other can use it
}

```

### Message Buffer

### Optimization Out variable

When using a compiler it will optimize out most of the debug code and also some variable that code related to them as It thinks that they are just constant(we may be modifying them in a ISR)
